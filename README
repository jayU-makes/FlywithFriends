This project is not functional yet! But you can try seeing how the API works by going into hackathon/unir.py! Don't forget to download the csv file from the same folder.
You can also see how the design of the web page will look by going over to FlywithFriends/hackathon/web/index.html! The webpage does not work yet and is only to show how it will look.
